# Boolean-SAT-Using-Grovers-Algorithm

#Motivation
Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm to search for an element in unsorted array quadratically faster than the classical linear search for large datasets.

In this project, we will solve a boolean satisfiability problem using Grover's algorithm by searching through all the possible combinations to determine the correct ones.

#Problem Statement
Frank wants to throw a dinner party to celebrate Alice and Bob’s engagement. He is also considering inviting their mutual friends Charles, Dave and Eve. However, he is aware that Charles will come to the party only if Dave comes without Eve. Frank wants to know what possible combinations of invitations he can write for his friends Alice, Bob, Charles, Dave and Eve.

Help Frank calculate all the possible combinations using Grover’s algorithm.
