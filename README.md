# Grover's Algorithm
Grover's algorithm, also known as the quantum search algorithm, refers to a quantum algorithm for unstructured search that finds with high probability the unique input to a black box function that produces a particular output value, using just {\displaystyle O({\sqrt {N}})}O({\sqrt  {N}}) evaluations of the function, where {\displaystyle N}N is the size of the function's domain.

# Problem Statement
Frank wants to throw a dinner party to celebrate Alice and Bob’s engagement. He is also considering inviting their mutual friends Charles, Dave and Eve. However, he is aware that Charles will come to the party only if Dave comes without Eve. Frank wants to know what possible combinations of invitations he can write for his friends Alice, Bob, Charles, Dave and Eve.

Help Frank calculate all the possible combinations using Grover’s algorithm.
